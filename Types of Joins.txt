1. INNER JOIN

👉 Returns only rows where both tables have a match.

SELECT C.CName, O.Orders
FROM Customers AS C
INNER JOIN Orders AS O
ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID;



2. LEFT JOIN / LEFT OUTER JOIN

👉 Returns all rows from left table + matched rows from right (NULL if no match).

SELECT C.CName, O.Orders
FROM Customers AS C
LEFT JOIN Orders AS O
ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID;



3. RIGHT JOIN

👉 Returns all rows from right table + matched rows from left (NULL if no match).

SELECT C.CName, O.Orders
FROM Customers AS C
RIGHT JOIN Orders AS O
ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID;



4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)

👉 Returns all rows from both tables, matching where possible, otherwise NULL.

SELECT C.CName, O.Orders
FROM Customers AS C
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders AS O
ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID;



5. CROSS JOIN

👉 Returns Cartesian product (all possible row combinations).

SELECT C.CName, O.Orders
FROM Customers AS C
CROSS JOIN Orders AS O;



6. SELF JOIN

👉 A table joins with itself (useful for hierarchical data).

SELECT A.CName AS Customer, B.CName AS Referrer
FROM Customers AS A
INNER JOIN Customers AS B
ON A.RefID = B.CustomerID;



7. NATURAL JOIN

👉 Joins automatically on columns with the same name in both tables.

SELECT *
FROM Customers
NATURAL JOIN Orders;


⚡ Note: If you write JOIN without ON, 

   SELECT * FROM Customers JOIN Orders;

   it becomes a CROSS JOIN, multiplying rows.
